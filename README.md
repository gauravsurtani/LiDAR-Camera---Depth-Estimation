# Camera Lidar Sensor Fusion Project

Hello,

To whoever who runs this file, you can import it on Google Colab since I utilized the High RAM and GPU feature, I considered builiding it there.

Make sure to upload this Google Colab before running it!

Thank you!



## Introduction
This repository contains the work and research associated with the Camera Lidar Sensor Fusion Project. It includes course work, background research, project proposals, and specific research on Bayesian Decision Making in Social Learning and LiDAR Camera Sensor Fusion.

## Input
This is the video we have from the KITTI dataset.

## Structure

### Bayesian Decision Making in Social Learning
This section of the repository holds all the research and findings related to Bayesian decision-making processes within the context of social learning environments.

### LiDAR_Camera_SensorFusion_Research
Here, the research focused on the integration of LiDAR and camera data for sensor fusion applications is stored.

### To-do : Using Folium to perform the Geospatial analysis of the vehicle:
Utilize the GPS/IMU sensor data to plot the route the car takes in the video.
